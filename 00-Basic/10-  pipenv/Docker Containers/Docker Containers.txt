This results in a smaller image, which can still run your application. Here is an example Dockerfile, which you can use as a starting point for doing a multistage build for your application:



Note
------
Pipenv is not meant to run as root. 
However, in the multistage build above it is done nevertheless. 
A calculated risk, since the intermediate image is discarded. 
The runtime image later shows that you should create a user 
and user it to run your application. 
Once again, you should not run pipenv as root (or Admin on Windows) normally. 
This could lead to breakage of your Python installation, 
or even your complete OS.

COMMAND:
    sudo docker build --no-cache -t oz/123:0.1 .
